## by Xuan Kuang


## Dataset

> This document explores the Ford GoBike data with approximately 1,860,000 bike rides records from 2018/01 - 2018/12. The attributes included the trip start/end time, as well as additional measurements such as longitude/latitude of start stations. 11 data points were removed from the analysis due to location of start station is outside of San Francisco Bay Area.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found followingï¼š

> In terms of user profiling
- Rides made by subscribers are more than five times of customers
> 
> In terms of ride statistics
- During weekdays, peak hours are 7am - 9am and 4pm - 6pm.
- During weekends, there is no obvious peak hours, users ride primarily from 10am to 6pm.
- Customer generally spent longer time on each ride than Subscriber.

> When compared ride start hour and weekday/weekend between Customer and Subscriber, each user type shows different pattern.
- Customers ride more on weekends than weekdays between 10am - 6pm.
- Subscriber primarly ride on weekdays around 7am-9am and 4pm-6pm.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> My presentation focuses on different user type patterns bewteen Subscriber and Customer.
> 
> Most of the subscribers are using the bike sharing system maily for commuting, and they are more likely to be the citizens in the related location. That can explain why more subscribers took use of the bike sharing system in the rush hours of weekdays rather than weekends.
> 
> On the other hand, most of the customers used the bike sharing system maily for leisure purpose, and they are more likely to be the visitors in those locations. That can explain why more customers took use of the bike sharing system in the daytime on weekends, and relatively less of them took bike rides on weekdays.
