# Data Analyst Nanodegree

### Xuan Kuang Created on 28-Jun-2020

The repository contains projects for Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). 

I took this online course to advance data analytics skills with Python. This course focuses on Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, and A/B Hypothesis Testing.

### Part 1: Investigate a Dataset -Introduction to Data Analysis
Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

##### Project - Explore Weather Trends

In this project, you'll get familiar with SQL, and learn how to download data from a database. You’ll analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

##### Project - Investigate a Dataset

You will choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

### Part 2: Practical Statistics

Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.

##### Project - Analyze A/B Test Results

Analyze the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to decide whether the company should implement new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to increase user conversion rate.

### Part 3: Wrangle and Analyze Data

Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.

##### Project - Wrangle and Analyze Data

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python, you'll gather data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. You'll document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python.

### Part 4: Data Visualization

Learn to apply visualization principles to the data analysis process. Explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.

##### Project - Communicate Data Findings

You will use Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore a selected dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, you will create a presentation that communicates your findings to others.
